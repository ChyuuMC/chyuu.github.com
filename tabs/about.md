### Who am I?
I am a girl from Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). I moved to Czech Republic, specifically to Hradec Kralove, back in 2016 to study medicine. Currently, I am in the 5th year of my studies. 

### Why did I create this website?
I remember my days back in the first year. I came here alone without knowing anybody here. First year was difficult for me in terms of adapting to the new environment. I didn't know how to dress for the winter, what to eat in Czech Republic, where to find what nor how to communicate in Czech language. 

### The goal
The goal of the English version of this page is to help the first years in their adaptaion process, especially outside their studies. 

### What else is there?
I also have a Burmese version of this page where I share my knowlege of studying overseas to people in my country. If you have Google Chrome as a browser, it supports Burmese tranaslation to English so you are welcome to check it out, as well.

### You can buy me a book here!
