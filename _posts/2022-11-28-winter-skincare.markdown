As somebody who is originally from a region of 95% and above humidity, facing a dry winter weather for the first time was not easy.  I had cracked skin to a point where it starts to bleed especially at my knuckles. Since then I started to explore ways to keep my skin hydrated and protected from the wind and cold.

### Body care

It is pretty simple. I just need two things: body cream and hand cream.

#### Body Creams

Here, you can find a good and affordable, lighter weight moisturiser. I would recommend these:

* [Neutrogena Fast Absorbing Body Lotion](https://www.notino.cz/neutrogena/norwegian-formula-deep-moisture-hloubkove-hydratacni-telove-mleko-pro-suchou-pokozku/)  is a light-weight body lotion that does its job to keep the skin well moisturised. On top of that, it is non-greasy, quick drying which means, it won’t stick to your winter clothes. It also comes in a [fragrance free](https://www.notino.cz/neutrogena/norwegian-formula-deep-moisture-hloubkove-hydratacni-telove-mleko-pro-suchou-a-citlivou-pokozku/) version for sensitive skin folks.

* [CeraVe Moisturising Lotion](https://www.notino.cz/cerave/moisturizers-hydratacni-mleko-na-telo-a-oblicej-pro-suchou-az-velmi-suchou-pokozku/) is another  light-weight lotion that can be used for face and body. However, I would recommend using for body only. Unlike the Neutrogena one, it contain ceramides that are beneficial for skin barrier.  My skin is more towards very dry side. Therefore, I prefer this moisturiser for summer season instead.

#### Hand Creams

For hand creams, I prefer a thicker, richer formula that are highly occlusive. They come in the form of balms or butter.

* [Neutrogena Fast Absorbing Comfort Balm](https://www.dm.cz/neutrogena-telovy-balzam-hydratacni-p3574660533576.html) is the best cream I’ve used for my dry hands. It is thick, occlusive yet absorbs quickly into the skin. 

* [Purity Vision’s Shea Butter](https://www.notino.cz/purity-vision/bio-bambucke-maslo/) is my new found favourite. I use the one with the [levandar scent](https://www.notino.cz/purity-vision/bio-maslo-s-levanduli/) before going to sleep. It makes my hands feel so smooth and nourished the next day.

Bonus tip: The way you wash your body is important, too. Having scorching hot shower, body peeling products, and spending a long time in the shower can contribute to dry skin, too. Use [nourishing body wash](https://www.notino.cz/lactovit/lactooil-jemny-sprchovy-gel/) with a gentle sponge and using only lukewarm water to wash yourself will keep your skin undamaged. Do in-shower moisturising routine so that you’ll apply the lotions and the balms while your skin is still hydrated. If you want to take a warm bath, add creamy bath gel or bath oil. 

### Face care

We have heard of those ten step skincare rituals, THAT girl skincare routine, which take too much time and products. What your face need is a good moisturiser and a face wash. That’s it! Only when you have extremely oily skin, you just need to add an affordable [Niacinamide serum](https://www.sephora.cz/p/niacinamide-10-zinc-1---formule-anti-imperfections-P3921091.html) from The Ordinary.

#### Face Wash

Opt for a nourishing and gentle face wash. Do not use face washes for acne that contain microbes for facial skin since they can dry out the skin further. 

* [CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser](https://www.notino.cz/cerave/cleansers-cistici-emulze-s-hydratacnim-ucinkem/) is suitable for dry winter months, since it hydrate the skin and doesn’t leave the skin feel dry and itchy after washing.

* [CeraVe Cleansing Oil](https://www.notino.cz/cerave/cleansers-cistici-olej-s-hydratacnim-ucinkem/) is not exactly an oil but can be used for both winter and summer since it is more light weight than the Hydrating Cleanser. 

* [Garnier Skin Naturals micellar water](https://www.notino.cz/garnier/skin-care-micelarni-voda-pro-citlivou-plet/p-420174/) is perfect for removing makeup. It is affordable and does its job in removing makeup very well. Soak a cotton pad with this micellar water and rub it gently and lightly over the face to remove makeup. After that, use a facial cleanser to double-cleanse your face. 

* [CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser](https://www.notino.cz/cerave/sa-cistici-a-zjemnujici-emulze-pro-normalni-a-suchou-pokozku/) is an exfoliating face wash. Instead of using physical exfoliators that includes micro beads, this cleanser use Salicylic Acid that breaks down the dark skin cells on your face that make your skin looks dull. After washing, your new skin layer will surface and it’ll leave your face glow. Note that this cleanser should be use just once a week, to be on a safe margin. Overusing this can make your skin dryer, too.

#### Face cream 

* [La Roche-Posay Toleriane Sensitive Rich](https://www.notino.cz/la-roche-posay/toleriane-sensitive-rich-prebioticky-hydratacni-krem-pro-zmirneni-citlivosti-pleti/) is a face cream that is suitable for all skin type especially for dry winter skin. It contains my favourite ingredients for my face such as squalene and niacinamide. 

* [La Roche-Posay Toleriane Sensitive Creme](https://www.notino.cz/la-roche-posay/toleriane-sensitive-prebioticky-hydratacni-krem-pro-zmirneni-citlivosti-pleti/) is the lighter version of the above cream. It is suitable for normal to dry skin for the winter.

* [RYOR Aknestop cream](https://www.notino.cz/ryor/aknestop-krem-s-fytosfingosinem-pro-problematickou-plet/) is suitable for those who are on the budget. This one is targeted for acne skin. Ryor is a Czech brand and their products are very affordable. Their [Marine Algae Care Cream](https://www.notino.cz/ryor/marine-algae-care-krem-s-kyselinou-hyaluronovou-a-kmenovymi-bunkami/) is also light weight and suitable for winter, too.

* [The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors](https://www.sephora.cz/p/facteurs-naturels-dhydratation-ha---formule-hydratante-P3921107.html) is a very basic moisturiser. Just like the name said, it has all the moisturising factors found in your skin. However, it is not a well rounded moisturiser. I would only recommend it to skin care pros who already knows what their skin needs. For example, I use this moisturiser with Niacinamide serum, a few drops of squalene and jojoba oil, and retinol serum at night. 

* [Cosrx Aloe sunscreen SPF 50](https://www.notino.cz/cosrx/aloe-opalovaci-krem-spf-50/) is optional. Personally, I don’t use it during winter days with UV index of 0-1. Unless I am going to higher altitudes such as for hiking trips. This sunscreen is my personal favourite since it doesn’t cause a white cast and keep my skin moisturised after using.

Tips: Skincare in general is figured out through trials and errors. You will find out which skincare works for you and which doesn’t through testing and trying different products. Be careful tough skincare products takes up to a month to work. Your skin needs time to adjust to new products. Some products with active ingredients like a Niacinamide serum or SA face wash can make the skin worse initially and the results will show only after a few weeks. Be patient. Of course, if a product burns and itch your skin, you should not use it anymore. 

### Hair care

My long hair used to be really dry and brittle during winter.  Here are a few tips on how to avoid that! 

#### Shampooing 

Use a regular shampoo. Instead of using hot water to wash your hair, use a lukewarm water.  First, use a small amount of shampoo on the damp hair. Then wash it off. Then, shampoo your hair normally. This method use less shampoo and make more foam in your hair which makes washing easier. 

After the shampoo starting to foam, I use a hair massage brush like [this one](https://www.notino.cz/lee-stafford/core-pink-masazni-kartac-na-vlasy-a-vlasovou-pokozku/) to gently massage my scalp. It helps your hair to move around and lift more dirt out of the roots. 

If you have really oily scalp, put a small amount of jojoba oil on your finger tips, rub it onto the roots of your hair and wait about 10 minute before shampooing.

#### Conditioning

Conditioner, masks, and oils. They all fall into this conditioning category. 

* I personally prefer a leave-in conditioner like this one [Nature Box Avocado Spray Conditioner](https://www.notino.cz/nature-box/avocado-oil-regeneracni-balzam-pro-poskozene-vlasy/).  After finish showering and my hair is still soaking wet, I spray this conditioner onto my hair. Then, flip my hair upside down. Scrunch the hair with my hands from ends to the roots so the water will squeeze out. 

* [Schwarzkopf Gliss Protein+ Hydrating Mask](https://www.notino.cz/schwarzkopf/gliss-protein-hydratacni-maska-s-kakaovym-maslem/) is my go to when my hair is very dry and needs more conditioning. I use this once a week. Simply leave it in your hair after shampoo while you’re washing the rest of your body.

* I have several favourite hair oils. [Aussie 3 Miracle Oil Reconstructor](https://www.notino.cz/aussie/3-miracle-oil-reconstructor-regeneracni-olej-na-vlasy-ve-spreji/) is a light weight oil and I like to use it for the dry ends of my hair. I combine [Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Oil](https://www.notino.cz/nuxe/prodigieuse-multifunkcni-suchy-olej-na-oblicej-telo-a-vlasy/) and [The Ordinary 100% Squalane](https://www.sephora.cz/p/100-squalane-derive-de-plantes---hydratant-502422.html) on the lengths of my hair for the really nice shine and conditioned effect.

Tips: Use a hair dryer after shower. Use low or medium setting. If you can, find a hair dryer that has a diffuser head. It’ll save your hair from heat damage and keeps the shine. Before drying, spray on a few sprits of [heat protector like this one](https://www.dm.cz/tresemme-sprej-na-ochranu-vlasu-pred-teplem-keratin-smooth-p8710908694134.html) to avoid heat damage and drying out your hair.

Have a glowing skin and shiny hair all winter long!
