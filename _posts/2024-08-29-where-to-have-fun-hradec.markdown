![Jiraskovy Sady](:IMG_6372.jpg){:data-align="center"}

If you are looking for places to decompress, here are a few places you might enjoy.

### Parks and Nature

#### Jir√°skovy Sady

[Jirask‚Äôs Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6kgU2Y9tjUeiCB3H9) is a unique garden located between two rivers: Elbe and Orlice. Here you can see some roses during the summer. Around the year, you will be able to spot nutrias, ducks and geese along the river. It is a beautiful place to be when you just need a walk around a park. It is right behind UHK. 

#### ≈†imkovy Sady

[This park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2tCiApMQxXJTymAL6) is located behing a medical faculty building. It is a place to be if you enjoy picnics and lakes. Bring out your picnic mat during the summer and enjoy the sunshine in this park. 

#### Kemp St≈ô√≠brn√Ω Rybn√≠k

[Silver Lake Camp](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6FghWXcua9tnSPot5) is a place to be if you enjoy camping, beach volleyball and football. Check out their price list [here](https://www.kempstribrnyrybnik.cz/en/price-list-2024/#:~:text=BORROWING%20PRICE%20LIST). You can take a bus to this place from Na Kotli bus stop and get down at Stribrny rybnik stop. Bring your tent or make a short trip. Enjoy a beer or two next to a lake, take a walk along the forest behind the camp, play volleyball at their court or stay a night in your tent. The options are endless here. 

#### Lake Bi≈ôiƒçka

[This lake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3Ay5mac97PuiZ2JR8) is just a few minutes walk from Palachova dormitory. There are many walking and running trails around this lake. During the deep winter, the lake freezes up and the locals enjoy ice skating and ice hokey on this lake. The forest around it turns into a magical winter land covered in snow.

#### Mil√≠≈ô Lookout Tower

If you are feeling advanturous and wants to go for a long walk, I recommend walking to this [tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3Ay5mac97PuiZ2JR8). It is about 2 hours walk from Palachova dormitory. From this place, you can see beautiful views of Hradec urban landscape, Kunƒõtick√° Hora castle in the distance and Opatovice electric plant. If you are lucky, you might be able to grab a beer at a pub right below the tower.

#### Mƒõtsk√© Lesy 

[Hradec Kralove city forest](https://www.mestske-lesy.cz/) is a lush green area, mostly consists of pine trees, is easily accessible from Palachova dormitory. You can go for a walk, jog, or cycling in this forest. It is pet friendly. If you have time, I recommend to check out [this place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xL9jt9nE48sCSyE3A) where you can see red deers, muflons, wild boars, etc. 

### Indoor activities

#### SNHK

[SNHK](http://www.snhk.cz/) offers variety of indoor activities. Hradec Kralove can be very cold during the winter and some of us international students would prefer to do something indoors. On its website, you can find [50m swimming pool](http://www.snhk.cz/bazen) for the swimmer athelets. [Aquacentrum](http://www.snhk.cz/lazne) that is famous for its large pool with waves and 82m water slide. Furthermore, you can check out their summer **Flo≈°na pool**, **wellness studio** and **squach center** in the same website. **Note**: Before you go, please check the pool schedule. Sometimes there are women only hours. Make sure to buy a watch with a chip and use your ISIC to save money on your entries.

#### Sport Climbing

[Lezeck√° Stƒõna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mwqTcJYKgEVUts4F8) is located next to Futurum. It has a large climbing wall and offers [group workshops](https://eshop.stenahk.cz/produkty/skupinove-zazitky.htm) for who are new to rock climbing. 

#### Bowling Alley

[A Sport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LRW9gep2Rao62mB58) is located behing Futurum and it offers [bowling](https://www.a-sport.cz/nase-sluzby/bowling#priceList) and [other activities](https://www.a-sport.cz/). Make sure to check this place out if you are planning to grab drinks with a group of friends while doing indoor sports. Don‚Äôt forget to reserve the bowling alley before you go.

#### Bonstep Dance School

[Bonstep](https://www.bonstep.cz/) mainly offers latin american dance classes if you want to learn something new with your friends. They also have fitness classes. My favourite one is Zumba. You can register on their website to the classes you want to go and make payment in cash once you are there. This place is next to Aupark and you can get there by getting off at Hlavni Nadrazi bus stop.

### In the vicinity of Hradec Kralove

#### Pardubice

The city of Pardubice boasts its first train station in the entire Czech Republic. Therefore, you will notice that almost all the international trains go through this lovely city. But don‚Äôt forget to check out the city itself! It is just 20 minutes train ride from Hradec Kralove and just 10 minutes walk from Pardubice main train station to the city centre. There is a [Pardubice Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p6EvzSAHiYoLwD816) with the East Bohemian Museum inside but the main attraction of the castle are the beautiful peacocks! After your day trip around the city, don‚Äôt forget to relax in this retro [Cafe Bajer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bHEpcx1r4U8ZMaNT7) and grab a cup of coffee or drinks. 

#### Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√© Zoo

[This zoo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mDfHzbhrPJaTnp9R9) is located in a city called [Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√© nad Labem](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Tawr3BBJK5SkN21q7) that is about 30 minutes train ride from Hradec Kralove. It is called a Safari Zoo Park because there is a Safari park attached to the zoo itself. You can book an accommodation or camp there but I recommend doing a day trip. The zoo is inspired by African safari and you will see various animals from Africa: elephants, giraffs, zebras, etc. To get there, you‚Äôll need to get a train from Hradec main train staion. From the Dvur Kralove train station, you‚Äôll take a city bus that takes you straight to the zoo. Don‚Äôt forget to use iDOS app to check the bus schedules.

#### Adr≈°pach rocks

[Adrspach rock formations](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ouA7BJw5dE9rCUzF8) is a national park that is about 1 hours and 40 minutes train ride from Hradec Kralove. The entrance is next to the train station. This place is nice to visit all year round. The park has rock formations that used to be under the sea. The views are breathtaking and ESN organise trips to this place every semester. However, if you want to go there by yourself, you must make a reservation to enter this place [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ouA7BJw5dE9rCUzF8) before your trip. I recommend to do a day trip. 

#### Je≈°tƒõd Tower in Liberec

This pagoda looking [tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6NaGmFSJVHQNHL746) is located in the city of Liberec. You can take a train to this city from Hradec Kralove that takes about two and a half to three hours and then, take a tram to the base of the hill. From there, the climb is about an hour or two. The tower mainly serves as a television tower but inside it is a three star hotel and a restaurant. I highly recommand to plan your lunch here for the panoramic view of Liberec region. This trip can be done in a day and you‚Äôll still have a plenty of time to visit the city of Liberec itself.

#### Snƒõ≈æka

[The hightest peak in Czech Republic](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yXvYdi4ygcimeKFQ7). All you need to do is take an hour and a half bus or a train ride from Hradec Kralove to a city called [Pec pod Snezkou](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aH9LxiVMysPj3Kvb9) and hike for two hours. Check iDOS. There are also cable cars available to the top. You can totally do this trip in a day if you plan it well. There are stunning views on the top but make sure to go there when there is a clear weather.  

I hope you found a few places to help you find new places around Hradec and to beat the winter blues.
